## Hi there 👋 My name is Uxío Juncal

I am an Spanish student of the University Carlos III de Madrid, currently studnig Informatic Engeneneering (at least that is how we call it here) and Business Management. I am generally interested in most of the fields of the computer science, but right now I spend most of me 'free' time learning about web developement, since I spent some months working on the maintenance of web pages. By now, in coding I am just a beginner.

Now here is the basic gitHub template for profile READMEs:
